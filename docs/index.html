        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is a F# language class. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin development environment (Windows or macOS) to run the exercise on. Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
         In this class we will be exploring the functional aspects of F# and why you should prefer them over the object-oriented features inherited from .NET. We will also be looking at how to use one of the most powerful features of F# - pattern matching.
        </p>

            <li><div class="objective">Utilizing option types to sum numbers</div>
            <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this group exercise, we will sum a set of option types together.

            <li><div class="objective">Applying partial application</div>
            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, you will build a generic distance function to calculate the distance between two points.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Practice pattern matching</div>
            <a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this group exercise, you will build a generic distance function to calculate the distance between two points.

            <li><div class="objective">Apply pattern matching to create a daily routine</div>
            <a href="./parts/part4.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, you will generate a daily schedule for a 31-day month which will output your breakfast and commute route.

            <li><div class="objective">Utilizing active patterns to create a flight itinerary</div>
            <a href="./parts/part5.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, you will utilize active patterns to calculate which airline had the lowest domestic deplaning count in SFO for December of every year.
